# ðŸŽ¬ Comparative Sentiment Analysis: LSTM vs BERT on IMDB Movie Reviews

This project compares the performance of two NLP models â€” an **LSTM-based** and a **Transformer-based (BERT)** â€” on the **IMDB movie reviews sentiment dataset**.
The main idea is checking how training order affect accuracy and f1 over time between different trainings.

In order to run the program and train the model yourself you are welcomed to:
1. clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ErezLavi/nlp-final-project.git
```
2.  Set Up a Python Virtual Environment
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
3. Than install the requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Is it also possible to run it on a GPU with kaggle from that link:
